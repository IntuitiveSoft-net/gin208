After long period of inactivity you will need to re-issue authentication toward AWS with the following command :

```
aws sso login
```

**AWS CLI configuration**

If you made a typo or want to edit a configuration of AWS CLI you can manage it by modifying the AWS configuration file located here :

```
~/.aws/config
```

File should contains

```
[default]
sso_session = devops
sso_account_id = 708113109960
sso_role_name = DevopsLab
region = us-east-1
output = json
[sso-session devops]
sso_start_url = https://intuitivesoft.awsapps.com/start#
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
```
