# AWS Terraform Lab

Objectives

- understand Infrastructure as Code principles
- understand Terraform HashiCorp configuration language (HCL) and workflow
- experiment Terraform with AWS provider
- understand AWS network concepts and modelisation

## Insight 1. Access Key for Terraform Provider

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources. IAM supports the use of access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS from the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, direct AWS API calls or automation tools like Terraform. You can have a maximum of two access keys (active or inactive) at a time.

For your protection, you should never share your secret keys with anyone. As a best practice, we recommend frequent key rotation.

## Task 2. Retrieve your AWS secrets

**If you already configured AWS CLI you can skip this Task**

You need to specify application credentials for authentication and permissions on the AWS API.

**- Task 2.1 -**

Connect to the training SSO portal : 

 [__https://intuitivesoft.awsapps.com/start#/__](https://intuitivesoft.awsapps.com/start#/)

Select your training AWS account and click the link  `Command Line or programmatic access` to retrieve your credentials.

![](images/aws_login.png)

**- Task 2.2 -**

Configure your aws cli with your SSO information 

```bash
aws configure sso
```

Expected output

```
SSO session name (Recommended): YOUR_SSO_USERNAME
SSO start URL [None]: https://intuitivesoft.awsapps.com/start#
SSO region [None]: us-east-1
SSO registration scopes [sso:account:access]:
Attempting to automatically open the SSO authorization page in your default browser.
If the browser does not open or you wish to use a different device to authorize this request, open the following URL:

https://device.sso.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

Then enter the code:

XXXX-XXXX

The only AWS account available to you is: 708113109960
Using the account ID 708113109960
The only role available to you is: DevopsLab
Using the role name "DevopsLab"
CLI default client Region [None]: us-east-1
CLI default output format [None]: json
CLI profile name [DevopsLab-708113109960]: default

To use this profile, specify the profile name using --profile, as shown:

aws s3 ls --profile default
```

**If you misconfigured your environment check the FAQ**

## Task 3. Install Terraform on Linux

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y gnupg software-properties-common wget
```

Add the HashiCorp GPG key.

```bash
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg

```

Add the official HashiCorp Linux repository.

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
```

Update to add the repository, and install the Terraform CLI.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y terraform
```

## Task 4. Verify the installation

```bash
terraform -help
```

You should see something similar to:

```console
Usage: terraform [global options] <subcommand> [args]

The available commands for execution are listed below.
The primary workflow commands are given first, followed by
less common or more advanced commands.

Main commands: ...
```

## Task 5. Create a subnet (and your first Terraform script)

Create a folder on the Linux machine to host the Terraform script you are going to write for that very first step. Example ```mkdir create-subnet```. In that dedicated folder create a file called ```main.tf```.

## Task 6. Define create-subnet main script

**- Task 6.1 -**

Terraform code is written in the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) in files with the extension .tf. It is a declarative language, so your goal is to describe the infrastructure you want, and Terraform will figure out how to create it. The first step to using Terraform is typically to configure the provider(s) you want to use. Create an empty folder and put a file in it called ```main.tf``` that contains the following contents:

```console
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

where:

- ```region``` is the us-east-1 region

**- Task 6.2 -**

For each type of provider, there are many different kinds of resources that you can create, such as servers, databases, and load balancers. The general syntax for creating a resource in Terraform is:

```console
resource "<PROVIDER>_<TYPE>" "<NAME>" {
  [CONFIG ...]
}
```

where ```PROVIDER``` is the name of a provider (e.g., aws), ```TYPE``` is the type of resource to create in that provider (e.g., subnet), ```NAME``` is an identifier you can use throughout the Terraform code to refer to this resource (e.g., this), and ```CONFIG``` consists of one or more arguments that are specific to that resource.

For example, to deploy a subnet in an AWS VPC, use the aws_subnet resource in ```main.tf``` as follows:

```console
resource "aws_subnet" "this" {
  vpc_id     = "vpc-REDACTED"
  cidr_block = "192.168.1.0/24"

  tags = {
    Name = "podx-public-subnet"
  }
}
```

where 

- ```vpc_id``` is the vpc id of your pod
- ```cidr_block``` is the IP network you want to allocate to the subnet
- ```tag:Name``` is the name you want to give to the subnet

The resulting file looks like 

```console
#Configure aws provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

#Create a subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "this" {
  vpc_id     = "vpc-REDACTED"
  cidr_block = "192.168.1.0/24"

  tags = {
    Name = "podx-public-subnet"
  }
}
```

## Task 7. Terraform init

In a terminal, go into the folder where you created main.tf and run the terraform init command:

```bash
terraform init
```

You should see a result like this:

```console
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/tls...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/local...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/aws...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/random...
...
Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

The ```terraform``` binary contains the basic functionality for Terraform, but it does not come with the code for any of the providers (e.g., the AWS provider, Azure provider, GCP provider, etc.), so when you’re first starting to use Terraform, you need to run ```terraform init``` to tell Terraform to scan the code, figure out which providers you’re using, and download the code for them. By default, the provider code will be downloaded into a ```.terraform``` folder, which is Terraform’s scratch directory (you may want to add it to .gitignore). Terraform will also record information about the provider code it downloaded into a ```.terraform.lock.hcl``` file.  Just be aware that you need to run init any time you start with new Terraform code, and that it’s safe to run init multiple times (the command is idempotent).

## Task 8. Terraform plan

Now that you have the provider code downloaded, run the terraform plan command:

```bash
terraform plan
```

You should see a similar output:

```console
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_subnet.this will be created
  + resource "aws_subnet" "this" {
      + arn                                            = (known after apply)
      + assign_ipv6_address_on_creation                = false
      + availability_zone                              = (known after apply)
      + availability_zone_id                           = (known after apply)
      + cidr_block                                     = "192.168.1.0/24"
      + enable_dns64                                   = false
      + enable_resource_name_dns_a_record_on_launch    = false
      + enable_resource_name_dns_aaaa_record_on_launch = false
      + id                                             = (known after apply)
      + ipv6_cidr_block_association_id                 = (known after apply)
      + ipv6_native                                    = false
      + map_public_ip_on_launch                        = false
      + owner_id                                       = (known after apply)
      + private_dns_hostname_type_on_launch            = (known after apply)
      + tags                                           = {
          + "Name" = "podx-public-subnet"
        }
      + tags_all                                       = {
          + "Name" = "podx-public-subnet"
        }
      + vpc_id                                         = "vpc-REDACTED"
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run
"terraform apply" now.
```

The ```plan``` command lets you see what Terraform will do before actually making any changes. This is a great way to sanity check your code before unleashing it onto the world. The output of the plan command is similar to the output of the ```diff``` command that is part of Unix, Linux, and git: anything with a plus sign ```(+)``` will be created, anything with a minus sign ```(–)``` will be deleted, and anything with a tilde sign ```(~)``` will be modified in place. In the preceding output, you can see that Terraform is planning on creating an AWS subnet and nothing else, which is exactly what you want.

## Task 9. Terraform apply

To actually create the subnet, run the terraform apply command:

```bash
terraform apply
```

You should get a similar output:

```console
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_subnet.this will be created
  + resource "aws_subnet" "this" {
      + arn                                            = (known after apply)
      + assign_ipv6_address_on_creation                = false
      + availability_zone                              = (known after apply)
      + availability_zone_id                           = (known after apply)
      + cidr_block                                     = "192.168.1.0/24"
      + enable_dns64                                   = false
      + enable_resource_name_dns_a_record_on_launch    = false
      + enable_resource_name_dns_aaaa_record_on_launch = false
      + id                                             = (known after apply)
      + ipv6_cidr_block_association_id                 = (known after apply)
      + ipv6_native                                    = false
      + map_public_ip_on_launch                        = false
      + owner_id                                       = (known after apply)
      + private_dns_hostname_type_on_launch            = (known after apply)
      + tags                                           = {
          + "Name" = "podx-public-subnet"
        }
      + tags_all                                       = {
          + "Name" = "podx-public-subnet"
        }
      + vpc_id                                         = "vpc-REDACTED"
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: 
```

You’ll notice that the apply command shows you the same plan output and asks you to confirm whether you actually want to proceed with this plan. So, while plan is available as a separate command, it’s mainly useful for quick sanity checks and during code reviews, and most of the time you’ll run apply directly and review the plan output it shows you.

Type ```yes``` and hit Enter to deploy the subnet:

You should get a similar output:

```console
aws_subnet.this: Creating...
aws_subnet.this: Creation complete after 1s [id=subnet-026552bf9f58e52f9]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Congrats, you’ve just deployed a subnet in your AWS account using Terraform! To verify this, head over to the AWS console; and you should see something similar to:

![](images/terraform-create-subnet.png)

## Task 10. Terraform state

You can notice a file named terraform.tfstate in the folder from where you run the terraform script. Terraform maintain the state of the configuration in that file, meaning that if you delete the subnet from the AWS console, you will have a mismatch between the configuration intent specified in the terraform.tfstate file and what is really configured on AWS. 

From AWS console rename the public subnet you have deployed.

![](images/terraform-rename-subnet.png)

If you plan a Terraform deployment again you will notice Terraform can detect the changes.

```console
terraform plan
```

You should have an equivalent statement:

```console
aws_subnet.this: Refreshing state... [id=subnet-0783f8621ad659e83]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the
following symbols:
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_subnet.this will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "aws_subnet" "this" {
        id                                             = "subnet-0783f8621ad659e83"
      ~ tags                                           = {
          ~ "Name" = "wrong-name" -> "pod1-public-subnet"
        }
      ~ tags_all                                       = {
          ~ "Name" = "wrong-name" -> "pod1-public-subnet"
        }
        # (15 unchanged attributes hidden)
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
...
```

It tells you what has been modified and what will be deployed if the terraform plan is applied. Let's apply the deployment again:

```console
terraform apply
```

and input ```yes``` when asked, and check the subnet is created on the AWS console.

## Task 11. Terraform show

When you run ```terraform show``` you can inspect the configuration state as it is stored by Terraform. You should have something similar to:

```console
terraform show
# aws_subnet.this:
resource "aws_subnet" "this" {
    arn                                            = "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:REDACTED:subnet/subnet-05a8e65d3872e6c1a"
    assign_ipv6_address_on_creation                = false
    availability_zone                              = "us-east-1f"
    availability_zone_id                           = "use1-az5"
    cidr_block                                     = "192.168.1.0/24"
    enable_dns64                                   = false
    enable_resource_name_dns_a_record_on_launch    = false
    enable_resource_name_dns_aaaa_record_on_launch = false
    id                                             = "subnet-05a8e65d3872e6c1a"
    ipv6_native                                    = false
    map_customer_owned_ip_on_launch                = false
    map_public_ip_on_launch                        = false
    owner_id                                       = "REDACTED"
    private_dns_hostname_type_on_launch            = "ip-name"
    tags                                           = {
        "Name" = "pod9-public-subnet"
    }
    tags_all                                       = {
        "Name" = "pod9-public-subnet"
    }
    vpc_id                                         = "vpc-REDACTED"
}
```

## Task 12. Terraform destroy

When you’re done experimenting with Terraform, either at the end of this section, or at the end of future sections, it’s a good idea to remove all of the resources you created so that AWS doesn't’t charge you for them. Because Terraform keeps track of what resources you created, cleanup is simple. All you need to do is run the destroy command:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

You should get a similar output:

```console
aws_subnet.this: Refreshing state... [id=subnet-026552bf9f58e52f9]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_subnet.this will be destroyed
  - resource "aws_subnet" "this" {
      - arn                                            = "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:REDACTED:subnet/subnet-026552bf9f58e52f9" -> null
      - assign_ipv6_address_on_creation                = false -> null
      - availability_zone                              = "us-east-1a" -> null
      - availability_zone_id                           = "use1-az4" -> null
      - cidr_block                                     = "192.168.1.0/24" -> null
      - enable_dns64                                   = false -> null
      - enable_resource_name_dns_a_record_on_launch    = false -> null
      - enable_resource_name_dns_aaaa_record_on_launch = false -> null
      - id                                             = "subnet-026552bf9f58e52f9" -> null
      - ipv6_native                                    = false -> null
      - map_customer_owned_ip_on_launch                = false -> null
      - map_public_ip_on_launch                        = false -> null
      - owner_id                                       = "374187570784" -> null
      - private_dns_hostname_type_on_launch            = "ip-name" -> null
      - tags                                           = {
          - "Name" = "podx-public-subnet"
        } -> null
      - tags_all                                       = {
          - "Name" = "podx-public-subnet"
        } -> null
      - vpc_id                                         = "vpc-REDACTED" -> null
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value:
```

It goes without saying that you should rarely, if ever, run destroy in a production environment! There’s no “undo” for the destroy command, so Terraform gives you one final chance to review what you’re doing, showing you the list of all the resources you’re about to delete, and prompting you to confirm the deletion. If everything looks good, type ```yes``` and hit Enter; Terraform will build the dependency graph and delete all of the resources in the correct order, using as much parallelism as possible. In a minute, your AWS account should be clean again.

You should get a similar output:

```console
aws_subnet.this: Destroying... [id=subnet-026552bf9f58e52f9]
aws_subnet.this: Destruction complete after 0s

Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
```

And you can check that there is no more subnet in the AWS Console:

![](images/terraform-destroy-subnet.png)

## Task 13. Create Terraform variables

**-Task 13.1-**

copy your current ```main.tf``` script in another folder named ```create-subnet-with-variables```

**-Task 13.2-**

Input variables let you customize aspects of Terraform modules without altering the module's own source code. This allows you to share modules across different Terraform configurations, making your module composable and reusable. 

Let's define the following variables for our script:

- region
- vpc_id 
- cidr_block
- subnet_name

They are all of type string so it can be defined in a ```variable.tf``` definition file like this:

```console
variable "region" {
  type = string
}
variable "vpc_id" {
  type = string
}
variable "cidr_block" {
  type = string
}
variable "subnet_name" {
  type = string
}
```
Each input variable accepted by a module must be declared using a ```variable``` block. The label after the ```variable``` keyword is a name for the variable, which must be unique among all variables in the same module. This name is used to assign a value to the variable from outside and to reference the variable's value from within the module. The name of a variable can be any valid identifier except the following: source, version, providers, count, for_each, lifecycle, depends_on, locals. These names are reserved for meta-arguments in module configuration blocks, and cannot be declared as variable names.

To set lots of variables, it is more convenient to specify their values in a variable definitions file named ```terraform.tfvars```. A variable definitions file uses the same basic syntax as Terraform language files, but consists only of variable name assignments.

```console
region = "us-east-1"
vpc_id = "vpc-REDACTED"
cidr_block = "192.168.1.0/24"
subnet_name = "podx-public-subnet"
```

## Task 14. Re-write your script with variable references

The new main.tf file is re-written to leverage the variables definition file as they are know accessible through the ```var``` prefix:

```console
#Configure aws provider
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

#Create a subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "this" {
  vpc_id     = var.vpc_id
  cidr_block = var.cidr_block

  tags = {
    Name = var.subnet_name
  }
}
```

Within the module that declared a variable, its value can be accessed from within expressions as var.<NAME>, where <NAME> matches the label given in the declaration block.
Note: Input variables are created by a variable block, but you reference them as attributes on an object named var.

## Task 15. Check the create-subnet still work

Check that the re-factored code is still working fine by exercising Terraform workflow: 
1. terraform init
2. terraform plan 
3. terraform apply 
4. terraform destroy

## Task 16. Let's use datasource and output in Terraform

copy your current ```create-subnet-with-variables``` folder in another folder named ```create-subnet-with-datasource```. 

Keep only the files:

- ```main.tf```
- ```variables.tf```
- ```terraform.tfvars```

You can check everything is cleaned-up in your folder with a ```tree . -all``` command. If not installed do so with ```sudo apt  install tree```

```bash
tree . -all
.
├── main.tf
├── terraform.tfvars
└── variables.tf
```

## Task 17. Add datasource to main script

Instead of defining the ```vpc_id``` as a variable we can use Terraform to read the ```aws_vpc``` resource we created manually in order to retrieve the configured object structure. Data sources allow Terraform to use information defined outside of Terraform, defined by another separate Terraform configuration, or modified by functions. A data source is accessed via a special kind of resource known as a data resource, declared using a data block

The ```main.tf``` file is modified like this:

```console
#Configure aws provider
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

#Read vpc resource 
data "aws_vpc" "this" {
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = var.vpc_name
  }
}

#Create a subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "this" {
  vpc_id     = data.aws_vpc.this.id
  cidr_block = var.cidr_block

  tags = {
    Name = var.subnet_name
  }
}

#Capture vpc_id in output variable
output "vpc_id" {
  value = data.aws_vpc.this.id
}

#Capture vpc_cidr_block in output variable
output "vpc_cidr_block" {
  value = data.aws_vpc.this.cidr_block
}
```

A ```data``` block requests that Terraform read from a given data source ```("aws_vpc")``` and export the result under the given local name ```("this")```. The name is used to refer to this resource from elsewhere in the same Terraform module, but has no significance outside of the scope of a module.

The data source and name together serve as an identifier for a given resource and so must be unique within a module.

Within the block body (between ```filter { }```) are query constraints defined by the data source. Most arguments in this section depend on the data source, and indeed in this example ```tag:Name``` is the argument defined specifically for the aws_vpc data source.

When the ```aws_subnet``` resource is created, we can now refer to the ```aws_vpc``` data source to get the ```vpc_id``` configuration argument. 

Therefore note the ```vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.this.id``` in the resource configuration definition.

## Task 18. Modify variables and values

As we are not using the vpc_id variable anymore but the vpc_name, it has to be defined in the ```variables.tf``` and ```terraform.tfvars``` files.

The modified files look like the following:

- variables.tf

```console
variable "region" {
  type = string
}
variable "vpc_name" {
  type = list
}
variable "cidr_block" {
  type = string
}
variable "subnet_name" {
  type = string
}
```


- terraform.tfvars

```console
region = "us-east-1"
vpc_name = ["pod2-vpc"]
cidr_block = "192.168.1.0/24"
subnet_name = "podx-public-subnet"
```

**Remark**. Note that the variable *vpc_name* is a "list" and not a string. This is simply due to the [AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpcs.html) which takes a list as arguments ("values", plural, with an S). The parameter in the '.tfvars' file is thus defined with square brackets ["pod2-vpc"], specifying a list (as in many other languages). 

## Task 19. Check the create-subnet still work

Check that the re-factored code is still working fine by exercising Terraform workflow: 1. terraform init, 2. terraform plan, 3. terraform apply and 4. terraform destroy.

Note that we are also using a new Terraform construct call ```output``` in the ```main.tf``` script. Output values make information about your infrastructure available on the command line, and can expose information for other Terraform configurations to use. Output values are similar to return values in programming languages. Each output value exported by a module must be declared using an output block. The label immediately after the output keyword is the name, which must be a valid identifier.

In our case we have defined the following outputs:

```console
#Capture vpc_id in output variable
output "vpc_id" {
  value = data.aws_vpc.this.id
}

#Capture vpc_cidr_block in output variable
output "vpc_cidr_block" {
  value = data.aws_vpc.this.cidr_block
}
```

which allow us to display the following information when applying the terraform script:

```console
aws_subnet.this: Creating...
aws_subnet.this: Creation complete after 1s [id=subnet-01c421b0f08a51037]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

vpc_cidr_block = "192.168.0.0/16"
vpc_id = "vpc-REDACTED"
```

## Task 20. Create 2x subnets script

Based on what you have seen from the previous steps, please define and test a terraform script which create two subnets like:

- subnet1:
    - tag:Name = "podx-public-subnet"
    - cidr_block = "192.168.1.0/24"
- subnet2:
    - tag:Name = "podx-private-subnet"
    - cidr_block = "192.168.2.0/24"

Ideally create a folder named ```create-2-subnets``` to place your script and other files.

## Task 21. Test your script

Check that the code is working fine by exercising Terraform workflow: 1. terraform init, 2. terraform plan, 3. terraform apply and 4. terraform destroy. Please check on the AWS console you have achieved the right results, you should see something similar to:

![](images/terraform-create-2-subnets.png)

## Task 22. Create a custom route table

For this step it is asked to define a Terraform script (with associated variables definition) to create a route table with the following attributes:

- tag:Name = "podx_public_route_table"
- associate the route table with already provisioned ```podx-public-subnet```
- add a default route ```0.0.0.0/0``` via an internet gateway to be provision

We foresee you will use:

- the provider ```aws```
- datasource with the appropriate filters:
    - aws_vpc
    - aws_subnet 
- resource with the appropriate config arguments:
    - aws_internet_gateway
    - aws_route_table 
    - aws_route_table_association

Ideally create a folder named ```create-route-table``` to place your script and other files.

To help with the exercise don't hesitate to have a look to the Terraform documentation, for example on:

- ```aws_internet_gateway```: <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/internet_gateway>
- ```aws_route_table```: <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/route_table>

![](images/terraform-create-security-group.png)

## Task 26. Create a key pair

For this task it is asked to define a Terraform script (with associated variables definition) to create a key pairs with the following attributes:

- Name = "podx-vm-key"
- algorithm = "RSA"
- rsa_bits  = 4096

We foresee you will use:

- the provider ```aws```
- resource with the appropriate config arguments:
  - tls_private_key: to generate the RSA/4096 key 
  - local_file: to save the content ```private_key_pem``` of the ```tls_private_key``` resource
  - aws_key_pair: to create the key pair in AWS including the ```public_key_openssh``` of the ```tls_private_key``` resource

Ideally create a folder named ```create-key-pair``` to place your script and other files.

To help with the exercise don't hesitate to have a look to the Terraform documentation.

## Task 27. Test your script

Check that the code is working fine by exercising Terraform workflow: 1. terraform init, 2. terraform plan, 3. terraform apply and 4. terraform destroy. Please check on the AWS console you have achieved the right results, you should see something similar to:

![](images/terraform-key-pairs.png)

Check also that the private key has been saved locally in the folder where you performed the ```terraform apply``` action with the command ```cat podx-vm-key.pem```.  
You should have something similar to that:

```
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

## Task 28. Create an EC2 instance

For this task it is asked to define a Terraform script (with associated variables definition) to create an EC2 instance with the following attributes:

- Name = podx-vm
- Image = ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-20211129
- Subnet = podx-public-subnet
- Security group = podx-ssh-security-group
- Instance type = t2.nano
- Associate public IP address = true
- Source Destination Check = false

We foresee you will use:

- the provider ```aws```
- datasource with the appropriate filters:
  - aws_security_group selected with its ```name```
  - aws_key_pair selected with its ```key_name```
  - aws_subnet filtered with ```tag:Name```
  - aws_ami selected with ```owners``` and filtered with ```tag:architecture``` and ```tag:name```
- resource with the appropriate config arguments:
  - aws_instance

For convenience, you can also capture the public IP address of the instance using an output returning the value ```aws_instance.this.public_ip```

Ideally create a folder named ```create-ec2-instance``` to place your script and other files.

To help with the exercise don't hesitate to have a look to the Terraform documentation !

## Task 29. Test your script

Check that the code is working fine by exercising Terraform workflow: 1. terraform init, 2. terraform plan, 3. terraform apply and 4. terraform destroy. Please check on the AWS console you have achieved the right results, you should see something similar to:

![](images/terraform-ec2-instance.png)

Please check also you can access via ssh the EC2 instance:

```ssh -i podx-vm-key.pem ubuntu@34.201.76.90```

You should get access to the instance

## Task 30. Terraform graph

Terraform manages for you the dependency resolution, i.e. it is capable to understand which resources have to be deployed first as others depend of it, as well as deploying independent resources in parallel.

Execute ```terraform graph > digraph.dot``` to save the dependency graph of the EC2 instance deployment in ```digraph.dot``` file. You can visualize the graph with Graphviz tool, and you should have something similar to:

![](images/terraform-dependency-graph.png)
