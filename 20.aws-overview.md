## Insight 3. Shared Responsibility Model

The AWS Shared Responsibility Model is a framework that outlines the division of security and compliance responsibilities between Amazon Web Services (AWS) and its customers. It helps clarify which security aspects are managed by AWS and which aspects are the responsibility of the customer. This model is crucial for ensuring a secure and compliant environment in the cloud.

The model is generally divided into two main categories:

 **AWS Responsibility**

AWS is responsible for the security "of" the cloud infrastructure. This includes the underlying physical data centers, networking, hardware, and foundational services that AWS provides. AWS takes measures to ensure that its infrastructure is resilient, redundant, and protected against common threats. This includes aspects like:

- Physical security of data centers and infrastructure
- Network architecture and protection
- Hardware maintenance and management
- Availability of services
- Patching and updating of infrastructure components

 **Customer Responsibility**

Customers are responsible for the security "in" the cloud. This means that customers are responsible for securing the data, applications, and configurations they deploy on AWS services. This includes aspects like:

- Data protection and encryption
- Identity and access management (IAM)
- Configuration and management of virtual machines and containers
- Security groups and firewall rules
- Application-level security and code
- Compliance with regulations and industry standards

In summary, while AWS ensures the security and reliability of its infrastructure, customers are responsible for securing the applications, data, and workloads they run on AWS services. The Shared Responsibility Model emphasizes collaboration between AWS and its customers to create a secure and compliant cloud environment. By understanding and following this model, customers can take appropriate measures to implement security best practices and protect their assets in the cloud.

## Insight 4. VPC and Networking

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) is a networking service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to create and manage a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network environment. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you might operate in your own data center, but with the benefits of cloud scalability and flexibility.

VPC, Subnet and Security Group:

Key features and components of AWS VPC include:

- **Isolation and Control**: With VPC, you can define your own virtual network topology, including IP address ranges, subnets, and route tables. This enables you to isolate your resources and control the network traffic flow within your VPC.

- **Subnets**: VPC allows you to divide your virtual network into subnets, which are smaller segments of the VPC's IP address range. Subnets can be public (accessible from the internet) or private (not accessible from the internet). You can use these subnets to deploy different types of resources based on their security and accessibility requirements.

- **Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)**: Security Groups and NACLs are used to control inbound and outbound traffic to and from your AWS resources. Security Groups are associated with individual resources and operate at the instance level, while NACLs are associated with subnets and operate at the subnet level.

- **Internet Gateway (IGW)**: An Internet Gateway allows resources in your VPC to access the internet and enables inbound traffic from the internet to reach your resources if you configure your subnets to be public.

- **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)**: A Virtual Private Gateway enables your VPC to establish secure VPN connections to your on-premises network, extending your data center to the AWS Cloud.

- **Peering**: VPC peering allows you to connect two VPCs together, enabling resources in different VPCs to communicate with each other as if they were on the same network.

- **VPN Connections**: VPC supports creating encrypted VPN connections to securely connect your on-premises data center to your VPC.

- **Direct Connect**: AWS Direct Connect provides dedicated network connections from your on-premises data center to AWS, bypassing the public internet.

- **Elastic IP Addresses**: Elastic IP addresses are static, public IP addresses that you can allocate to your instances, providing a consistent way for your resources to be accessed from the internet.

- **Route Tables**: Route tables define the traffic routes within your VPC. You can associate different route tables with different subnets to control the flow of traffic.

- **Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateways/Instances**: NAT gateways or NAT instances allow instances in private subnets to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while preventing inbound traffic from reaching them.

AWS VPC provides a robust and flexible networking foundation for deploying various types of applications in a secure and isolated manner within the AWS Cloud environment. It allows you to design and configure your network infrastructure according to your specific requirements and best practices.

## Insight 5. AWS Security services
